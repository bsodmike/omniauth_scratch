# Multi-Auth

This is based on implementing Omniauth thanks to the excellent two-part Railscasts on Omniauth ([Part 1](http://railscasts.com/episodes/235-omniauth-part-1), [Part 2](http://railscasts.com/episodes/236-omniauth-part-2)) by Ryan Bates with a twist â€” integrated with [authentication from scratch](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch) rather than Devise.
